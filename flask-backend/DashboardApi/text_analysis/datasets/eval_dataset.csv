Nevertheless, improved local air quality is an important broader impact of certain mitigation actions and programmes (e.g. Climate and Clean Air Coalition). The availability of such data could also help to support a case for scaled-up mitigation actions domestically, for example by enabling researchers to better assess the benefits of mitigation actions in addition to costs. To capture these important relationships, several institutions track output and outcome indicators relevant to transportation and energy access (e.g. the number of expected beneficiaries of a project).",13,1,8,0.7777777777777778

In this period, stakeholders highlight certain treaty obligations, while downplaying or ignoring others.
