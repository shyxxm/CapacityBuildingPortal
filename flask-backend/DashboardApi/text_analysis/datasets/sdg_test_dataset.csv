Those sectors, in Hirschman’s framework, have more backward and forward linkages; the former referring to provision of inputs from other activities and sectors, the latter to demand for new activities. The development policy challenge is, accordingly, about identifying lead sectors, addressing missing linkages and strengthening inter-industry and intersectoral interdependencies to boost productivity growth. In this sequence, infrastructure would follow rather than lead the growth process. It is laigely around this sequencing issue that differences between balanced and unbalanced growth strategies emerged in early development policy debates (see box 4.2).

Raising income and corporate taxes, which weigh mainly on the formal sector, would limit the reduction in disincentives to formality. There is thus room for more risk pooling, as it would reduce the overall cost of contributoiy programmes. Risk pooling refers to the collection and management of financial resources in a way that spreads financial risks from an individual to all members of the programme. From a policy perspective, risk-pooling arrangements attempt to manage the need to subsidise care for people with the highest health risks (horizontal redistribution), the lowest ability to pay (vertical redistribution), or both when facing a health shock (Baeza and Packard, 2006).

This poses a problem for the metro-region’s future attractiveness, as public transit access and ease of mobility have been cited as key factors in the region’s high rankings among world cities. The Regional Transport Authority (RTA), which serves six counties and 88% of the population in the metro-region, has applied most of its funding on operations (over USD 2 billion annually) rather than maintenance or capital investment.23 This is due in part to operating costs that have outpaced inflation, rising 4.5% annually (CMAP, 2010a). Approximately half of RTA's operating costs are financed by fares and other system-related revenues (e.g. advertising and concession), with the remainder supplied by an RTA sales tax applied, a real estate transfer tax in the City of Chicago, and state matching funds and contributions.",7,1,4,0.6

National authorities had accurately forecast this typhoon, and the accompanying seven-metre high storm surge, several days in advance.9 Nevertheless at least 6,300 people were killed, mostly by the storm surge.

When they do, their benefits tend to be lower than men’s, reflecting the joint impact of shorter periods of paid work, more part-time work and lower earnings. In some countries, this can especially harm low-income women who have lower (formal) labour market participation and may also lack access to derived benefits if they are single or divorced from/widowed by an informal worker with no pension rights. Indeed, the extent to which gendered labour markets effectively affect women’s pension entitlements depends on specific aspects of pension design that are particularly relevant for gender equality. In contributory social insurance systems, workers are typically entitled to a retirement benefit when they reach the retirement age and have a minimum number of years of work and/or contributions.
